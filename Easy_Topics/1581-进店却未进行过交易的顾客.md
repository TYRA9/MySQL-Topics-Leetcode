    ```sql
    # Write your MySQL query statement below
    # Method One: LEFT JOIN
    SELECT
        `V`.`customer_id`,
        COUNT(*) AS `count_no_trans`
    FROM
        `Visits` `V`
    LEFT JOIN
        `Transactions` `T` ON `V`.`visit_id` = `T`.`visit_id`
    WHERE 
        `T`.`transaction_id` IS NULL
    GROUP BY
        `V`.`customer_id`;


    # -------------------------
    # Method Two: RIGHT JOIN
    SELECT
        `V`.`customer_id`,
        COUNT(*) AS `count_no_trans`
    FROM
        `Transactions` `T`
    RIGHT JOIN
        `Visits` `V` ON `T`.`visit_id` = `V`.`visit_id`
    WHERE 
        `T`.`transaction_id` IS NULL
    GROUP BY
        `V`.`customer_id`;


    # -------------------------
    # Method Three: NOT EXISTS
    SELECT
        `V`.`customer_id`,
        COUNT(*) AS `count_no_trans`
    FROM
        `Visits` `V`
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM `Transactions` `T`
        WHERE `T`.`visit_id` = `V`.`visit_id`
    )
    GROUP BY
        `customer_id`;


    # -------------------------
    # Method Four: NOT IN
    SELECT
        `V`.`customer_id`,
        COUNT(*) AS `count_no_trans`
    FROM
        `Visits` `V`
    WHERE `V`.`visit_id` NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT `visit_id`
        FROM `Transactions` 
    )
    GROUP BY
        `V`.`customer_id`;
    ```
